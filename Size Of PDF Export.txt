I noticed a font size problem in exporting Crystal Report using Crystal 11.5 and ASP.Net 3.5.  In this case I needed to export a Crystal Report contains some barcodes.  The barcodes in the exported PDF had a very small font size. Searching web, I found that this issue can be fixed using to registry keys:

SAP Knowledge Base Article:

    To resolve the behavior

        Set the resolution of the default printer of the local computer experiencing the issue to 1200 DPI. Most printers have a default setting of 600 DPI.
        Create two registry keys to prevent the crxf_pdf.dll from decreasing in font size.
        Click Start > Run. Type “regedit”. The Registry Editor appears.
        Create the following keys for Crystal Reports XI with the defined values:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.0\Crystal Reports\Export\PDF\ForceLargerFonts
        Type: DWORD
        Recognized Values: 0,1
        Default Value: 1
        Creation Method: manual

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.0\Crystal Reports\Export\PDF\ForceLargerFonts
        Type: DWORD
        Recognized Values: 0,1
        Default Value: 1
        Creation Method: manual
        Set both registry key values to 1 to turn them on.
        Create the following keys for Crystal Reports XI Release 2 with the defined values:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports\Export\PDF\ForceLargerFonts
        Type: DWORD
        Recognized Values: 0,1
        Default Value: 1
        Creation Method: manual

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports\Export\PDF\ForceLargerFonts
        Type: DWORD
        Recognized Values: 0,1
        Default Value: 1
        Creation Method: manual
        Set both registry key values to 1 to turn them on.
        Restart the Crystal Reports Page, Job and Cache Servers

and for the Unix server:

    UNIX, an X server client such as x-win32 must be installed. Add the keys as follows:

        Launch the X server client (alternatively use xming on the client machine and export the display to the client machine.
        Login as business Objects user
        Go to the business objects installation folder: cd  <bobje install>/bobje/setup/
        Sorce env.sh (for example: . ./env.sh).
        Type regedit
        Create the registry keys as detailed below.
            Create the following keys for Crystal Reports XI Release 2 with the defined values:
            Create a new key under ‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports’ called ‘Export’
            Create a new key under ‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports\Export’ called ‘PDF’
            Create a new Dword value called ‘ForceLargerFonts’ under ‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports\Export\PDF’
            Set the value to 1 (just double click on the name you just created)
            Create a new key under ‘HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports’ called ‘Export’
            Create a new key under ‘HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports\Export’ called ‘PDF’
            Create a new Dword value called ‘ForceLargerFonts’ under ‘HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports\Export’
            Set the value to 1 (just double click on the name you just created).
        Restart the Crystal Reports Page, Job and Cache Servers.

I followed the provided instruction in SAP knowledge base but it did not work for me. I set the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE which I expected to affect IIS, and then I set the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry (which to me is not relevant as IIS uses different profile), then restarted the web server. The result was still barcode printing in small font.

Further search on the web I found a new solution in SAP community forum: https://forums.sdn.sap.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1161804

    1. Press Ctrl-Alt-Del on your keyboard, then click the Task Manager button. Click the Processes tab. The security account is listed beside your process name (for IIS 5 the process name is aspnet_wp.exe and for IIS 6 it is w3wp.exe).

    2. Open the registry editor. On the Start menu, click Run then type “regedit” and click OK.

    3. Navigate to the following registry sub key:

    HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

    There will be a number of keys here that start with “S-1-5?. Inspect each one and look for your security account name in the ProfileImagePath entry. Take note of the key (folder) you are on when you find your process.

    4. Go to the following registry sub key:

    HKEY_USERS[your security profile]\Software\Crystal Decisions\10.2\Crystal Reports\Export\Pdf

    5. Right-click the sub key and click New > DWORD Value. Name the DWORD value “ForceLargerFonts” and set it to the value of 1.

    6. Restart IIS, and try the application again.

My experience:

    The IIS running on a XP machine where the Process Name (Image Name) equals to aspnet_wp.exe and the User Name equals to  ASPNET.   Looked at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList and found that  S-1-5-21-1085031214-562591055-839522115-1004 has the value of

    Value Name: ProfileImagePath

    Value data: %SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings\TESTXP17908\ASPNET

    Next step: I added ForceLargerFonts value to HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1085031214-562591055-839522115-1004\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.5\Crystal Reports\Export\PDF.

    Restarted IIS

    Result: Problem solved :)








================================== Solustion 2 ==================================
If barcode size is not what you expect when export to PDF in Crystal Report, you need to look no further for solution.

To fix the bug, just follow steps below by adding 2 registry keys.

1. Select Start > Run. Type regedit and click OK.

2. For Crystal Reports 2008, Expand HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Business Objects\Suite 12.0\Crystal Reports\Export.

For Crystal Reports 11.0, Expand HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Business Objects\Crystal Reports.

For Crystal Reports 10.0, Expand HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Crystal Decisions\10.0\Crystal Reports\Export

For Crystal Reports 9,0, Expand HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\crystal decisions\9.0\Crystal Reports\Export

3. Right-click the Export folder and select New > Key. This creates a new folder. Name the new folder PDF.

4. Right-click the PDF folder and select New > DWORD Value.

5. Name this 'ForceLargerFonts' with no quotes and note that it is case sensitive.

6. Double-click ForceLargerFonts and change the Value data to 1 and click OK.

7. Close all the registry folders and expand the following registry For Crystal Reports 2008, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Business Objects\Suite 12.0\Crystal Reports.

For Crystal Reports 11.0, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Business Objects\Suite 11.0.

For Crystal Reports 10.0, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Crystal Decisions\10.0\Crystal Reports

For Crystal Reports 9.0, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Crystal Decisions\9.0\Crystal Reports

8. Right-click the Crystal Reports folder and select New > Key. Name this key Export.

9. Right-click the Export folder and select New > Key. This creates a new folder. Name this folder PDF.

10. Repeat steps 4 through 6.

11. Close the Registry Editor and restart Crystal Reports.


After adding these two registry keys, Crystal Reports won't have this font size problem any more.


However, if you want to generate barcode in Crystal Reports from IIS server, you need to modify permissions of these registry keys.

IIS security model prevents the application pool identity to read those registry entries by default.

Open Windows application Regedit and browse to

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Business Objects\Suite 12.0\Crystal Reports\Export\PDF

Right click the key and choose “Permissions” from context menu.



===========================================================

Add two DWORD keys and set their values as 1:
Collapse | Copy Code

 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SAP BusinessObjects\Crystal Reports for .NET Framework 4.0\Crystal Reports\Export\PDF\ForceLargerFonts
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SAP BusinessObjects\Crystal Reports for .NET Framework 4.0\Crystal Reports\Export\Pdf\ForceLargerFonts
Add in default IIS user account. Usually it's IUSR_MachineName.
